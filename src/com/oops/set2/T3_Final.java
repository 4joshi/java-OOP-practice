//Summary:
    //1. Final Variable - becomes immutable, i.e., the value cannot be changed anymore
    //2. Final Method - cannot be overridden when the class is inherited
    //3. Final Class - cannot be inherited
    //               - Members of a final class are implicitly final as well, since they can never be overridden anyway as the class is final and can't be inherited

public class T3_Final {
